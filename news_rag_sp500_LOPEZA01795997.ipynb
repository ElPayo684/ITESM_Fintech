how to build a simple Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) pipeline using financial news articles from S&P 500 companies.\n","\n","We'll start by vectorizing text data, creating a vector store using FAISS, and integrating it with OpenAI's GPT models to answer questions using retrieved information.\n","\n","This workflow emulates real-world systems in finance where natural language data (news, filings, analyst reports) are used to support decision-making."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"35b70aaa","metadata":{"id":"35b70aaa"},"source":["# üìå Objectives\n","\n","By the end of this notebook, students will be able to:\n","\n","1. **Perform Semantic Search with Metadata Filtering:**\n","   - Query the provided FAISS vector store to retrieve relevant financial news articles based on natural language questions.\n","   - Apply optional filters using metadata such as ticker or publication date to refine search results.\n","\n","2. **Enrich Data with Company Metadata:**\n","   - Use the `yfinance` library to retrieve company-level metadata (company name, sector, industry) for tickers in the dataset.\n","   - Integrate this metadata to support enhanced filtering and analysis of news data.\n","\n","3. **Build a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) Pipeline:**\n","   - Combine retrieved news snippets as context to generate answers using OpenAI‚Äôs GPT models.\n","   - Construct effective prompts that guide the language model to provide concise, context-aware responses.\n","\n","4. **Evaluate and Analyze RAG Outputs:**\n","   - Review generated answers alongside the supporting news excerpts.\n","   - Reflect on the strengths and limitations of the simple RAG pipeline and consider potential improvements, such as adding more filters or refining retrieval strategies.\n","\n","5. **Incorporate Financial Metadata into Retrieval Context:**\n","   - Enrich retrieved news snippets with key financial metadata including ticker, company name, sector, and industry.\n","   - Format prompts that combine both text excerpts and metadata to provide richer context to the language model.\n","\n","6. **Generate Context-Aware Answers Using OpenAI Models:**\n","   - Construct and send prompts to an LLM that leverage both news content and metadata to produce concise, informed financial analysis.\n","\n","7. **Compare Answers With and Without Metadata:**\n","   - Evaluate the impact of including financial metadata on answer quality using criteria such as clarity, detail, accuracy, and contextual relevance.\n","   - Summarize findings to reflect on the role of metadata in improving retrieval-augmented generation."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c1034130","metadata":{"id":"c1034130"},"source":["## Install and Import important librairies\n","\n","First,

On one hand, there is a notable bullish sentiment from Wall Street, with analysts setting ambitious price targets for various stocks, suggesting attractive upside potential. For instance, several articles highlight stocks that are outperforming the market and have garnered significant attention due to positive catalysts, such as new product lines and favorable news flow [2][5]. \n\nHowever, there is also a prevailing skepticism regarding these optimistic forecasts. Analysts warn that institutional pressures may lead to overly positive outlooks, and they often hesitate to issue sell ratings due to concerns about losing business in other areas, such as mergers and acquisitions [1][3][4]. This duality in sentiment indicates that while there is enthusiasm for certain stocks, investors are advised to remain cautious and critically evaluate the underlying fundamentals.\n\n### Supporting Evidence:\n1. Wall Street's ambitious price targets suggest upside potential, but skepticism is warranted due to institutional pressures [1].\n2. Stocks are outperforming the market due to positive catalysts, indicating bullish sentiment [2].\n3.
