Financial News Data:**\n","    - Load a preprocessed dataset of financial news headlines and summaries related to S&P 500 companies.\n","    - Inspect and structure relevant metadata including publication date, ticker, and provider.\n","\n"," 2. **Build a Custom Vector Store:**\n","    - Combine title and summary text for embedding.\n","    - Implement a vector store from scratch with support for semantic search and optional metadata-based filtering using cosine similarity.\n","\n"," 3. **Generate and Use Sentence Embeddings:**\n","    - Apply a pre-trained transformer model (all-MiniLM-L6-v2) to encode text into embeddings for semantic analysis.\n","\n"," 4. **Perform Semantic Search with Filtering:**\n","    - Retrieve the most relevant news documents for a given query using both full-dataset and metadata-filtered searches.\n","\n"," 5. **Analyze Semantic Search Results:**\n","    - Interpret and visualize results of search queries (e.g., \"AI announcement\").\n","    - Identify temporal patterns and ticker frequency among top-ranked results.\n","\n"," 6. **Implement a FAISS-Based Vector Store:**\n","    - Normalize embeddings and use FAISS (IndexFlatIP) to enable efficient similarity search at scale.\n","    - Compare FAISS-based search results with custom vector store results.\n","\n"," 7. **Critically Compare Search Systems:**\n","    - Evaluate differences in similarity computation, speed, and scalability between custom and FAISS-based systems.\n","    - Reflect on design trade-offs for real-world vector search systems."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","id":"c1034130","metadata":{"id":"c1034130"},"source":["## Install and Import important
